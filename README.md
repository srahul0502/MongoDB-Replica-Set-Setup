# MongoDB Replica Set Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up a MongoDB replica set with three members on your local machine. A MongoDB replica set provides high availability and data redundancy. It ensures that your data is safe and accessible even if one of the members goes down.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Ubuntu-based Linux distribution (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
- Basic knowledge of the Linux command line
- Administrative (sudo) access to your machine

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mongodb-replica-set-setup
```

## Step 2: Run the Setup Script

Run the provided setup script to automate the MongoDB replica set configuration:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## Script Breakdown

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Update System Packages**: Ensures that your system's package information is up to date.

2. **Install Required Packages**: Installs necessary packages (`gnupg` and `curl`) required for the MongoDB installation process.

3. **Add MongoDB GPG Key**: Adds MongoDB's GPG key to verify the authenticity of MongoDB packages.

4. **Add MongoDB Repository**: Adds MongoDB's official repository to your system.

5. **Update System Packages Again**: Updates your system's package list with the MongoDB repository.

6. **Install libssl1.1 Package**: Installs `libssl1.1`, a required library for MongoDB.

7. **Install MongoDB**: Installs MongoDB and starts its service.

8. **Create MongoDB Configuration for Replica Set**: Configures MongoDB by creating a configuration file at `/etc/mongod.conf`. The configuration includes data path, logging settings, network port, and replica set name (`rs0`). JavaScript execution is disabled for security.

9. **Start MongoDB with New Configuration**: Launches MongoDB with the new configuration file.

10. **Restart MongoDB**: Restarts MongoDB to apply configuration changes.

11. **Start the First MongoDB Instance**: Initiates the first MongoDB instance with specific settings, including data path, port, and replica set name.

12. **MongoDB Shell and Initialize Replica Set**: Starts the MongoDB shell on port 27017 and initializes the replica set configuration. It adds a primary member, a secondary member, and an arbiter.

13. **Display Replica Set Status**: Uses the MongoDB shell to display the status of the replica set, confirming that it's set up correctly.

14. **Setup Complete**: A message indicates that the MongoDB replica set setup is complete.

## Access MongoDB

You can access MongoDB using the MongoDB shell:

```bash
mongo --port 27017
```

## Replica Set Configuration

The script sets up a replica set named `rs0` with three members:

- Primary Member (Port 27017)
- Secondary Member (Port 27018)
- Arbiter (Port 27019)

The WiredTiger cache for all members is configured to be 1GB, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Maintenance

If you need to stop or restart MongoDB, you can use the following commands:

- To restart MongoDB:
  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart mongod
  ```

- To stop MongoDB:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop mongod
  ```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a MongoDB replica set with high availability and data redundancy. Your MongoDB environment is now ready for your applications to use.

For more details on MongoDB configuration and usage, refer to the official MongoDB documentation.
